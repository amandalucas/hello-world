# hello-world
My first github project
My name is Amanda Lucas, born in Dublin, living in Offaly Ireland.
I have been working as a freelance designer, marketer, web designer for a while now and love my work.
I love my family and friends and enjoy outdoor pursuits - when it's sunny of course.
I spend my time learning additional front end development skills and building resposive sites on Itchy Fingers Design.
